#1.7.truechain\_ide\_remote\_breakpoint\_debug

This tutorials provides an introduction how to debug the go program on remote host use ide or dlv command line tool

##System requirements
Note: this article operates under the OSX system

* dlv

Delve is a debugger for the Go programming language. The goal of the project is to provide a simple, full featured debugging tool for Go



###Step 1

install the requirements

```
go get -u github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv

```

###Step 2

Launch the wallet debug program on the server

**Note:If the program is started and the program contains debugging information, you can skip it. Note the compile options (go build -gcflags "-N -l"), if you start the debug version. This way of starting is not recommended to follow.**

```
go run cmd/getrue/*.go
```

###Step 3

use dlv command line tool attach the wallet program and set stdout to network endpoint 

```
dlv attach $(ps -ef|grep $ProcessName)--headless --api-version=2 --log --listen=:8181
```

Note:  parameter **--listen=:8181 **is used to set port on the server e.g.: 8181


###debug with dlv

```
dlv connect ${remote_endpoint}

```

* b ${function} : Set a breakpoint on the main function

* c : Continue execution after the breakpoint

* b : ${go\_file:line\_number} Set breakpoints by line number

* bp : List the breakpoint 

* clear ${breakpoint} : Del the breakpoint

* bt : Print the stack information
* p : print the variable
* frame ${n} ${cmd} : Execute the corresponding instruction on the nth layer call stack

* goroutines : Print goroutines's information

###debug with vscode
configure the launch.json file
 
```
{
    "name": "Attach",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "remote",
    "remotePath": "${workspaceRoot}",
    "port": 8181,
    "host": "192.168.16.126",
    "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
    "env": {},
    "args":["--nodiscover", "--mine", "--etherbase", "8a45d70f096d3581866ed27a5017a4eeec0db2a1"],
}
```
check the arguments host and port was set to the remote host endpoint address.

then start the vscode debugger, do what you want to do.
